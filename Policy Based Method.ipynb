    "* So remember that the agent goal is always to **maximize expected return**.\n",
    "* Let's denote the expected return as $J$.\n",
    "* And weights in NeuralNetwork as $\\theta$.\n",
    "* And there's some mathematical relationship between $\\theta$ and the expected return $J$.\n",
    "* This is because $\\theta $ encodes the policy which makes some action more likely than others, and depending on action that influences the reward and then we sum up the rewards to get the return.\n",
    "* The main idea is that it's possible to write the expected return $J$ as the function of $\\theta$ for e.g. $J = F(\\theta)$.\n",
    "> $J(\\theta) = \\sum_{\\tau} P(\\tau;\\theta)R(\\tau)$\n",
    "<br>$\\sum_{\\tau} P(\\tau;\\theta)R(\\tau)$ = Expected value of reward across $\\tau$ timesteps, Expected value of a probability distribution is summation of probability of each sample in that distribution times(product) value of that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And we want to optimize the values of $\\theta$ such that it **maximizes the EXPECTED RETURN** $J$.\n",

    "### Hill Climbing\n",
    "* We begin with an initially random set of weights $\\theta$.We collect a single **episode** with the policy that corresponds to those weights and then record the return.\n",
    "* This return is an estimate of what the surface looks like at that value of $\\theta$.\n",
    "* Now it's not going to be a perfect estimate because the return we just collected is unlike to be equal to the expected return, but in practice the estimates often turns out to be good enough.\n",
    "* Then we add little bit of noise to those weights to give us another set of candidate weights we can try.\n",
    "* **To see how good those new weights are, we'll use the policy that they give us to again iteract with the environment for an episode and add up the return.**\n",
    "* In up the new weights, give us __more__ return than our current best estimate, we focus our attention on that new value, and then we just repeat by iteratively proposing new policies in the hope that they outperform the existing policy.\n",
    "* In the event that they don't we go back to our previous best policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working of the process\n",
    "* Consider the case that the neural network has only two weights.\n",
    "* The agent's goal is to maximize expected return $J$.\n",
    "* The weights in the neural network are $\\theta = (\\theta_0,\\theta_1)$\n",
    "* Then we can plot the expected return $J$ as a function of the values of both weights.\n",

To see that this might be a little bit strange, note that due to randomness in the environment (and the policy, if it is stochastic), it is highly likely that if we collect a second episode with the same values for $\\theta$ we'll likely get a different value for the return $G$. Because of this, the (sampled) return $G$ is not perfect estimate for the expected return $J$, but it often turns out to be **good enough** in practice.\n",

    "## Beyond Hill Climbing \n",
    "\n",
    "We denoted the expected return by $J$. Likewise, we used $\\theta$ to refer to weights in the policy network. Then, since $\\theta$ encodes the policy, which influences how much reward the agent will likely receive, we know that $J$ is a function of $\\theta$.\n",

    "Despite the fact that we have no idea what that function $J = J(\\theta)$ looks like, the *hill climbing* algorithm helps us determine the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes it.\n",

    "## Note\n",
    "We refer to the general class of approaches that find $arg\\ max_{\\theta} J(\\theta)$ through randomly pertubring the most recent best estimate as **stochastic policy search.**. Likewise, we can refer to $J$ as an **objective function**, which just refers to the fact that we'd like to *maximize it*!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements in Hill Climbing algorithm\n",
    "* One small improvement to this approach is to choose a small number of neighboring policies at each iteration and pick the best among a small number of neighboring policies at each iteration and pick the best among them.\n",
    "* Generate a few candidate policies by perturbing the parameters randomly and evaluate each policy by iterating with environment. \n",
    "* This give us an idea of the **neighborhood** of the current policy.\n",
    "* Now pick the candidate policy that looks most promising and iterate.\n",
    "* This variation is known as **steepest ascent hill climbing** and it helps to reduce the risk of selecting a next policy that may lead to suboptimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stimulated Annealing \n",
    "* Stimulated annealing uses a predefined schedule to control how the policy space is explored.\n",
    "* Starting with a large noise parameter, that is broad neighborhood to explore, we gradually reduce the noise or radius as we get closer and closer to the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adaptive Noise (Scaling)\n",
    "* Whenever we find a better policy than before, we're likely getting closer to the optimal policy.\n",
    "* This translate to reducing or decaying the variance of the Gaussian noise we add.\n",
    "* But if we don't find a better policy it's probably a good idea to increase our search radius and continue exploring from the current best policy.\n",

    "* Alias states are identical state, accroding to state feature(which can be limited, and reality are not identical) and have different optimal actions, but agent cannot differentiate between the states.\n",
    "* Best action that can be taken in these states are equiproable random action -- which value based methods are not able to do.\n",
    "* So the question is why value based methods are not good in these **alias state**?\n",
    "    * Because in value based the method; the method or technique by which we take random action is **epsilon-greedy method** and after training a value based method, our epsilon is small, becuase we can't take anymore random actions with smart agent!\n",

    "* Now if actin space is discrete and there are finite number of actions, we can easily pick the action with the maximum value.\n",
